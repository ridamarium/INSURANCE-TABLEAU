# INSURANCE-TABLEAU

The Tableau dashboard delivers a comprehensive analysis of insurance policy data through interactive and visually intuitive dashboards. Policy distribution is analyzed by policy type, customer age groups, gender, and geography to understand portfolio composition. Time-series visualizations track policy issuance, renewals, and expirations by year enabling trend and seasonality analysis. Claim performance is evaluated through charts showing claim counts and statuses (approved, rejected, pending) to assess risk exposure and operational efficiency.  Percentage-based KPIs highlight renewal rates and claim approval ratios, while filters, parameters, and dashboard actions allow users to dynamically explore insights by policy type, time period, and customer segments, supporting data-driven decision-making in insurance operations.
